# wordGame
A program that uses a frequency-annotated vocabulary list to learn as efficiently as possible.
# Usage
```shell
go run wordGame.go go run wordGame.go -freqTableFname=italian-frequency-annotated.json -trajectoryFname=trajectory.json
```
This creates a file `trajectory.json` which can be deleted if one desires to clear the memory.
